# Tic Tac Toe
I did that game as an excercise in the first month of a 1 year pythonic course I did on the web (which was awsome by the way)
This game is the good old tic tac toe game, each player in his own turn enter two numbers the first one is the row number and the second one is the column number, the numbers need to be between 0 to 2 (row and column numbers starts from 0 like a real programmmers:P).
